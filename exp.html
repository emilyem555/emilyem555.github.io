We are there for each other through it all, and provide a social safety net for each other. As well as the social benefits, membership provides resume reviews, workshops, and studying with like minded people. I hold two positions, Scholarship director and Alumni Engagement Director. As scholarship director, I encourage professional and academic development through resume workshops, setting up study hours, and resume pools. For Alumni Engagement, I send out newsletters to our alumni and set up events during homecoming and our big alumni gathering in the spring. </p> </td> <!--add info about my role and stuff-->
          <td style="width: 33%;"> <p>A program supporting women doing research. This allows me to learn more about what it takes to research through classes on researching, as well as working with a research group. It also allows me to grow and connect with the community of women in the program. </p></td>
          <td style="width: 33%;"><p>Every Sunday, me and other UIUC students spend a few hours teaching young girls essential coding concepts. After a semester of teaching and guiding them through projects to learn, we have them make their own project with the languages they have learned! As a facilitator, I help plan out and teach the activities to the children every week. It is a rewarding way to encourage more women to be interested in STEM concepts, as well as a great test in leadership and mentoring. </p></td>
