            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p> I am a CS student and math minor at the University of Illinois, and I am going to be graduating Spring 2027! Outside of classes I am involved in Phi Sigma Rho,
            Girls Who Code, Women in Computer Science, and CSSTARS. My favorite subjects in computer science are User interfaces, Math concepts in CS, and Data Structures.
            </p>
            <h3>Outside of College</h3>
            <p>I am an Illinois native from Normal, Il. I went to Normal West High School and was heavily involved in both choir and computer science activities. Nowadays, I spend my time pretty similarly. Outside of computer science and classwork, I spend my time playing music, reading, and knitting.</p>
            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>I am looking for an internship this upcoming summer, which will give me the experience I need for a full time job after graduation. Some things i would love to find in this internship are a supportive environment, real projects to work on, and a great team to work with. </p>
