This project is a fun exploration of making a website by essentially making an "about me" page. 
I'm not too creative, so this is my attempt to explore the wonders of web development. Below are some things included within this website:

 - A home page, featuring a picture of me ;)
 - An about page, with general information about who I am in life and Computer Science.
 - An experience page, with details about what I am currently involved in.
 - A resume page, with my most recent resume pdf embedded.

Will be continuously updated as I improve my web development skills, or my information changes!
